.SH NAME
menddb - the mend database

.SH DESCRIPTION
The mend database is a PostgreSQL database intended for flexible notetaking. It allows the user to take notes with little predefined structure and relate those notes together.

.SH TABLES
.PP
An \fIentity\fP is the most basic object in the mend database. It consists of only a primary key (UUID) and a timestamp representing when it was created. Entities contain little information on their own, and rely on \fIaliases\fP and \fInotes\fP to store meaningful information.
.PP
An \fIalias\fP is a meaningful way to refer to an entity, such as "ISO 3166." An alias consists of a primary key (UUID), the primary key of the entity to which it refers, the alias's contents, a precedence value, and a timestamp. The aliases precedence value is used to determine which alias is an entity's \fIprimary alias\fP.
.PP
A \fInote\fP contains additional information about an entity, such as "The ISO standard for country codes." A note consists of a primary key (UUID), the primary key of the entity it references, the note's content, a created timestamp, and an updated timestamp.
.PP
A \fIrelation\fP relates two entities. For instance, an entity representing "Microsoft Windows" could reference an entity representing "Operating System," as those two things are conceptually related.

.SH VIEWS
.PP
The \fIprimary_alias\fP view pairs entities with their alias with the lowest precedence. As entities can have multiple aliases, the \fIprimary_alias\fP view serves to assign an entity a single primary alias.
