.SH NAME
menddb - the mend database

.SH DESCRIPTION
The mend database is a PostgreSQL database intended for flexible notetaking. It allows the user to take notes with little predefined structure and relate those notes together.

.SH TABLES
.PP
An \fIentity\fP is the most basic object in the mend database. It consists of a primary key (UUID), name, and timestamp representing when it was created. Entities contain little information on their own, and rely on \fIaliases\fP and \fInotes\fP to store meaningful information.
.PP
An \fIalias\fP is an alternate name for an entity. An alias consists of a primary key (UUID), the primary key of the entity to which it refers, the alias's contents, and a timestamp.
.PP
A \fInote\fP contains additional information about an entity. A note consists of a primary key (UUID), the primary key of the entity it references, the note's content, a created timestamp, and an updated timestamp.
.PP
A \fIrelation\fP relates two entities. For instance, an entity representing "Microsoft Windows" could reference an entity representing "Operating System," as those two things are conceptually related.
